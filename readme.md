# DSA Assignment

hey, this repo has all my dsa assignment programs. compiled and tested on linux (gcc).

## whats inside

| file | what it does |
|------|-------------|
| prog_1.c | bracket matching using stack |
| prog_2.c | infix to postfix + evaluation |
| prog_3.c | linked list reverse print |
| prog_4.c | doubly linked list ops |
| prog_5.c | graph bfs/dfs |
| prog_6.c | heap construction |

each program has a doc file (doc_1.md, doc_2.md etc) with explanation and outputs.

## how to run

```bash
gcc prog_1.c -o prog_1
./prog_1
```

same for others, just change the number.

## notes

- prog_1 uses gets() which gives warning but works fine
- prog_2 only handles single digit numbers
- graphs are 0-indexed
